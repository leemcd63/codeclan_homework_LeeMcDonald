# MVP
## Question 1
Load the data, clean_names() and explore it.
```{r}
mobile_phones <- read_csv("data/20190928-items.csv") %>%
  clean_names()

head(mobile_phones, 10)
names(mobile_phones)
```

## Question 2
Find the brand with the highest numbers of phones in the dataset.
```{r}
top_brand <- mobile_phones %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarise(num_phones = n()) %>%
  slice_max(num_phones) %>%
  pull(brand)

top_brand
```

## Question 3
For your top brand, plot the distribution of phone ratings as a probability density, overlaying a fitted normal distribution. Do you think the normal distribution provides a good model of these ratings?

[Hint - you will need to calculate the mean() and sd() of the ratings to plot the appropriate normal. Alternatively, investigate using the fitdistr() function in the MASS package]

```{r}
# summarise for mean and sd of ratings for top brand
mobile_phones_stats <- mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == top_brand) %>%
  summarise(
    num = n(),
    mean_rating = mean(rating),
    sd_rating = sd(rating)
  )


# plot probability density and normal distribution overlay
mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == top_brand) %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x = rating) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "white", bins = 25) +
    stat_function(
      fun = dnorm, 
      args = list(
        mean = mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating, 
        sd = mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating
      ),
      col = "blue"
  )

```

The normal distribution fits the probability density of phone ratings fairly well, the majority of ratings fall beween 3-4 which is where the median is for this distribution. However there are extreme values (ratings of 1 and 5) which may skew the distribution.


## Question 4
We can be more quantitative in comparing the distribution of top brand ratings with a normal distribution. You calculated the mean() and sd() of your distribution in an earlier question. Use these values to calculate the proportions of ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean. Compare these proportions with those you expect for a normal distribution.

### Hint
You can use a filter() to get only the ratings within one-, two- and three standard deviations of the mean, and then think about how to calculate what proportion each of these filtered sets make of the total number of ratings. Youâ€™ll need to use three separate filter() and summarise() pipes to do this.

```{r}
# find proportion of ratings within 1 standard deviation
prop_1sd <- mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == top_brand,
         rating <= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating + mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating,
         rating >= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating - mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating) %>%
  summarise(prop = n() / mobile_phones_stats$num)

prop_1sd
```
```{r}
# find proportion of ratings within 2 standard deviations
prop_2sd <- mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == top_brand,
         rating <= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating + (mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating * 2),
         rating >= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating - (mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating * 2)) %>%
  summarise(prop = n() / mobile_phones_stats$num)

prop_2sd
```

```{r}
# find proportion of ratings within 3 standard deviations
prop_3sd <- mobile_phones %>%
  filter(brand == top_brand,
         rating <= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating + (mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating * 3),
         rating >= mobile_phones_stats$mean_rating - (mobile_phones_stats$sd_rating * 3)) %>%
  summarise(prop = n() / mobile_phones_stats$num)

prop_3sd
```

Proportion of values within:
1 sd - 0.7934509
2 sd - 0.9193955
3 sd - 0.9798489

Comparing this to the 3-sigma rule or 68-95-99.7 rule, there is a higher proportion of values within one standard deviation (79 vs 68) and a lower proportion within 2 (92 vs 95) and 3 (98 vs 99.7) standard deviations, indicating that this is not a normal distribution. As mentioned above for Question 3, this is likely due to the number of extreme low and high ratings in the data.
